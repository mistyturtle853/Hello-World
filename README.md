# Hello-World


Hey Im Christopher and I want to learn more about game programming. My first programming language was C++ which I experimented on a bit year a ago with a book, so I know the basic fundamentals of programming. I've also been learning about Visual Basic. One thing that I was surprised when learning Visual Basic was how simple its syntax was as compared to C++.
